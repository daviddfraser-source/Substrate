# Drift Assessment - PRD4 Area 11-0

## Scope Reviewed

- Area: `11-0` (Graph Core)
- Packets covered:
- PRD4-05-GRAPH-CORE-POSTGRES (11.0): status=done

## Expected vs Delivered

- Planned:
Implement PostgreSQL graph core and traversal APIs
- Delivered:
All packets in area `11-0` completed with evidence-linked lifecycle notes.

## Drift Assessment

- Drift identified:
No material implementation drift observed for this area in PRD4 execution.
- Root cause:
N/A
- Impact:
N/A

## Evidence Reviewed

- `.governance/wbs-state.json`
- `python3 .governance/wbs_cli.py log 200`
- Core artifacts under `src/substrate_core/`, `docs/codex-migration/`, and `reports/` produced by PRD4 packets.

## Residual Risks

- Continued integration hardening may be required for production deployment paths not exercised in isolated unit flows.

## Immediate Next Actions

1. Maintain regression coverage for substrate core lifecycle, policy, ontology, graph, audit, and trust modules.
2. Run environment-specific deployment validation for target runtime profiles.
