# Drift Assessment - PRD4 Area 6-0

## Scope Reviewed

- Area: `6-0` (Shared Core Contract)
- Packets covered:
- PRD4-01-SHARED-CORE-CONTRACT (6.0): status=done
- PRD4-11-SNAPSHOT-DIFF (6.0): status=done

## Expected vs Delivered

- Planned:
Enforce shared-core decision contract across surfaces; Implement state snapshot and diff (v4.1)
- Delivered:
All packets in area `6-0` completed with evidence-linked lifecycle notes.

## Drift Assessment

- Drift identified:
No material implementation drift observed for this area in PRD4 execution.
- Root cause:
N/A
- Impact:
N/A

## Evidence Reviewed

- `.governance/wbs-state.json`
- `python3 .governance/wbs_cli.py log 200`
- Core artifacts under `src/substrate_core/`, `docs/codex-migration/`, and `reports/` produced by PRD4 packets.

## Residual Risks

- Continued integration hardening may be required for production deployment paths not exercised in isolated unit flows.

## Immediate Next Actions

1. Maintain regression coverage for substrate core lifecycle, policy, ontology, graph, audit, and trust modules.
2. Run environment-specific deployment validation for target runtime profiles.
