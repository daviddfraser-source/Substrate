# Evaluation History

This folder stores timestamped snapshots of `reports/ai-substrate-eval.json`. Each snapshot is created by running `scripts/run-ai-eval.py` (generating the report) followed by `scripts/ai-eval-publish.js` (copying it into this directory and updating `LATEST.json`).

Use `LATEST.json` to find the most recent evaluation and link it from release notes or dashboards.
