# WBS Template Profiles

# Default Baseline
- File: `.governance/wbs.json`
- Use for clean clone-and-own initialization in new repositories.
- Keeps the default scaffold free from Substrate's internal upgrade roadmap.

## Minimal
- File: `templates/wbs-codex-minimal.json`
- Use when you need fast startup with basic governance controls.
- Includes 4 packets across init, execution, validation, and closeout.

## Full
- File: `templates/wbs-codex-full.json`
- Use for full migration/scaffold delivery with comprehensive governance and skill tracks.

## Existing Refactor Template
- `templates/wbs-codex-refactor.json` remains supported for legacy migration compatibility.
