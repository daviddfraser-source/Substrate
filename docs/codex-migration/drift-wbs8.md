# Drift Assessment: WBS 8.0 Rollout, Adoption, and Closeout

## Scope Reviewed
- Level-2 area: 8.0
- Included packet IDs: CDX-8-1, CDX-8-2, CDX-8-3, CDX-8-4, CDX-8-5
- Excluded/out-of-scope: post-migration roadmap execution

## Expected vs Delivered
- Planned outcomes: dry run, pilot, final summary, handoff, KPI definition.
- Delivered outcomes: rollout evidence and closeout artifacts completed.
- Variance summary: no unresolved closeout blockers noted.

## Drift Assessment
- Process drift observed: low; closeout artifacts are present and linked.
- Requirements drift observed: low; adoption/closeout goals satisfied.
- Implementation drift observed: low; evidence chain maintained via notes/docs.
- Overall drift rating: low

## Evidence Reviewed
- WBS state/log references: `.governance/wbs-state.json` entries for CDX-8-x.
- Artifacts/documents reviewed: `docs/codex-migration/dry-run.md`, `docs/codex-migration/pilot-report.md`, `docs/codex-migration/final-summary.md`, `docs/codex-migration/handoff.md`, `docs/codex-migration/post-launch-kpis.md`.
- Test/validation evidence: lifecycle completion records and evidence references.

## Residual Risks
- Post-launch discipline needed to sustain governance quality.
- KPI tracking can drift without periodic operational reviews.

## Immediate Next Actions
- Run scheduled drift reassessments per Level-2 area on major changes.
- Track KPI adherence and feed findings into backlog.

## Notes
- Cryptographic hashing is not required for this assessment.
