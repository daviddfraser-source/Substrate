# WBS 8.6 Post-Launch KPI Checkpoint

Date: 2026-02-13
Window: Initial post-migration checkpoint

## KPI Baseline
- Packet lifecycle command parity: achieved
- Report completeness (scope + packet-level evidence): achieved
- Automated quality gates in CI: achieved

## Observed Metrics
- WBS packets completed: 42/42
- Quality gates: pass
- Server API regression suite: pass

## Follow-Up Metrics (Recommended)
- % of completed packets with evidence paths in notes
- Mean time from claim to done by phase
- Number of blocked/failed packets per release cycle

## Corrective Action Triggers
- Any release with failing quality gates
- Missing packet evidence in closeout reports
- Drift between docs and CLI behavior
