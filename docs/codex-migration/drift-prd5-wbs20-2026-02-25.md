## Scope Reviewed
- WBS area `2-0` backend infrastructure and data model packets:
  - P5-07 multi-user governance schema
  - P5-08 execution/data/search/jobs infrastructure
  - P5-09 infra observability and docker deployment profile
  - P5-10 backend infrastructure DoD validation

## Expected vs Delivered
Expected:
- Multi-user isolated schema foundations
- Execution persistence/token/document/embedding/search/job backend primitives
- Observability wiring and reproducible Docker deployment profile
- DoD validation report with evidence

Delivered:
- Schema migrations `0002` and `0003` with isolation constraints and supporting indexes
- `ExecutionDataStore` + `AsyncJobWorker` runtime modules
- Observability endpoints (`/health`, `/readyz`, `/livez`, `/traces`) and structured logging upgrades
- Docker observability compose profile and configs
- Backend infra DoD report and machine-readable evidence JSON

## Drift Assessment
- No material scope drift observed.
- Minor implementation interpretation: indexed search was delivered via term index table rather than external search engine service; this still satisfies packet intent and remains reproducible locally.

## Evidence Reviewed

- `src/app/data/migrations/0003_execution_data_search_jobs.sql`

- `reports/phase5-backend-infra-dod.json`

## Residual Risks
- Production hardening for observability retention, alert routing, and secret management remains environment-specific and was intentionally not bundled into this packet set.

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Proceed to frontend foundation (`P5-11`) now unblocked.
2. Optionally add container image scanning and compose policy checks in CI as a follow-on hardening slice.
