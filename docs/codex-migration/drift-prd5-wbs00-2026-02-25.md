## Scope Reviewed
WBS area `0-0` contract baseline packet `P5-00`.

## Expected vs Delivered
Expected and delivered: authoritative contract baseline for Phase 5 APIs, events, policy schema, and determinism/concurrency rules.

## Drift Assessment
No drift observed.

## Evidence Reviewed
- `docs/codex-migration/contracts/phase5-v1/README.md`
- `docs/codex-migration/contracts/phase5-v1/api-contract-v1.md`
- `docs/codex-migration/contracts/phase5-v1/event-schema-v1.json`

- `docs/codex-migration/contracts/phase5-v1/determinism-concurrency-v1.md`

## Residual Risks
Contract evolution must remain versioned and backward-compatible.

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Enforce contract drift checks in CI for subsequent phases.
